#Demo

Hello, I'm Bryce Harrison and I'm a junior at Mississippi State University. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and am familar with C++ 
and Python as well as several miscellaneous programing tools. When I'm not in class or working with programming I like to run 5ks and 10ks.
Thank you for taking the time to read this appropriately named file.
